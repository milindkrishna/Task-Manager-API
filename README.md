# Task-Manager-API

This api based task management is build using Nodejs based Express framework with error handling feature

We have used mongodb as a database and mongoose as ODM. 

The model, route and controller based approach make the work more easier and easy to maintain.

Also middleware scope with express make the api more sustainable and easy to undestand by other dev users.
